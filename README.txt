There are 6 python files in this folder. Here are their descriptions:

freewavepacket.py
This file outputs an animation of a free wavepacket (no potentials). It also calculates the analytic wavepacket to compare

discretisation_error.py
This file outputs a graph of N vs. mean squared error (MSE). It calculates the MSE between the numerical and analytic values to get the optimal N value

TRvsk0.py
This file plots a graph of k_0 vs. the various probabilities.

single_potential.py
Gaussian wavepacket propagating through a potential

harmonic.py
Gaussian wavepacket propagating oscillating in a harmonic potential

2Dfreewavepacket.py
This file outputs an animation of a free wavepacket (no potentials) in 2D propagating horizontally.
